# DiffractionSHwaves-By-Wedges
## MATLAB CODE for Diffraction of elastic SH waves by wedges
This is an implementation of the analytic solution given in the paper:
Francisco J. Sánchez-Sesma; Diffraction of elastic SH waves by wedges. Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America 1985; 75 (5): 1435–1446.

#EXAMPLE to run the code:
wedgeSpaceWave(40, 1/2, 256, 0.04, 0.5,  0.4,  1, 0, 1.0,  -2.0,  4, 101, 101)
The main file is wedgeSpaceWave.m and the parameters called in this function are described inside this Matlab function. The other files are functions needed to run the main program.
